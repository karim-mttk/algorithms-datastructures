"""
The task is to analyze the array called "nums" and, for each element nums[i], 
determine the number of values in the array that are smaller than it. 
Specifically, this involves counting the number of valid j values, where j is 
not equal to i, and nums[j] < nums[i].

The result of this analysis should be returned as an array.
